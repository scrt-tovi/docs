# Testing Secret Contracts

**Unit tests** and **multitests** are critical components of software development that help ensure the quality, stability, and correctness of your Secret smart contracts. A single bug or vulnerability in a smart contract can lead to consequences such as the loss of funds or the compromise of sensitive information. By thoroughly testing Secret smart contracts with unit tests and multitests, developers can identify and address issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of errors and vulnerabilities for contracts that are deployed to Mainnet. Let's begin by learning about unit tests in Secret Contracts. ðŸŽ‰
