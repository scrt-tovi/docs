# Randomness API - Secret VRF

## Introduction

Secret Network's randomness API allows developers to access random numbers in their CosmWasm contracts, enhancing the capabilities of the platform. The randomness feature is accessible within Secret Contracts through the Env struct. It includes an optional random field, which contains a random number as a Binary type. The random field is only available when the "random" feature is enabled. In this tutorial, you will learn how to access the randomness feature and use it with a smart contract that returns a truly random coin flip ðŸŽ‰

### Use Cases

Randomness is essential in many applications, including:

* Gaming and gambling platforms, where fair and unpredictable outcomes are crucial
* Cryptographic systems that require secure random keys or nonces
* Randomized algorithms for various use cases, such as distributed systems or optimization problems

### How It Works

1. The proposer for each block generates a strong, random seed inside [SGX](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/overview-ecosystem-and-technology/techstack/privacy-technology/intel-sgx/overview).
2. This seed is then included in the block header and signed by all validators who can verify its authenticity inside their SGX.
3. Secret Network's in-SGX light client prevents the proposer from simulating a block before all other validators sign it. Consequently, the proposer cannot gain maximal extractable value (MEV) by generating random seeds until they find a favorable simulation of the block.
4.  Before calling the contract, the chain injects `env.block.random = hkdf_sha256(block_random_seed + wasm_call_count)`.

    Thus each contract call gets a unique random seed.

For a more in-depth explanation of why and how this method of randomness works feel free to read the [feature explainer](../secret-contract-fundamentals/available-native-features-modules/secret-vrf-on-chain-randomness.md)
{% endhint %}

### Enable the "random" feature

In your Cargo.toml file, add the "random" feature to the cosmwasm-std dependency:

```rust
[dependencies.cosmwasm-std]
git = "https://github.com/scrtlabs/cosmwasm"
rev = "8ee395ba033c392d7170c971df97f085edaed2d9"
package = "secret-cosmwasm-std"
features = ["random"]
```

_Note this will change as the feature gets merged into the main-line branch_

### Tutorial - Coin Flip

What follows is a step-by-step tutorial of how to use Secret Network's randomness API to generate a coin flip (returning either 0 or 1) with true randomness. You can follow along and/or view the completed code [in this repo](https://github.com/writersblockchain/SecretNetwork-Randomness-Tutorial).&#x20;

#### Environment Configuration

LocalSecret is a tool that allows you to run a local Secret Network on your machine for testing and development purposes. To use the new randomness feature with LocalSecret, you can leverage the localsecret:v1.9.0-beta.1-random Docker image, which supports the "random" feature for CosmWasm contracts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Secret Network's randomness API is currently only supported on LocalSecret testnet.
{% endhint %}

Here are the steps to use the randomness feature with LocalSecret:

1. [Configure your developer environment](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment) and be sure to install the [latest version of SecretCLI.](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/tools-and-libraries/secret-cli/install)
2. Clone the coin flip repo:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
git clone https://github.com/writersblockchain/SecretNetwork-Randomness-Tutorial.git
```
{% endcode %}

#### &#x20;Contract.rs

To consume the random number, you need to import the necessary dependencies in your `contract.rs` file in order to **access the random number from the env parameter.**&#x20;

In your contract, import the necessary dependencies (these are already imported in the cloned repo):

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Binary, Env, MessageInfo, Response, Result};
```

In the contract's entry point (e.g., execute, instantiate, or query), you can access the random number from the [env parameter](https://github.com/writersblockchain/SecretNetwork-Randomness-Tutorial/blob/8dbdfcca74507a98ac2bdb7bc18112a597fc727b/src/contract.rs#L32):

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Flip {} => try_flip(deps, env),
    }
}
```

The env and block\_info structures are defined as:

```rust
pub struct Env {
    pub block: BlockInfo,
    pub contract: ContractInfo,
    pub transaction: Option<TransactionInfo>,
}

pub struct BlockInfo {
    /// The height of a block is the number of blocks preceding it in the blockchain.
    pub height: u64,
    pub time: Timestamp,
    pub chain_id: String,
    #[cfg(feature = "random")]
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub random: Option<Binary>,
}
```

Where the random is 32 bytes long and base64 encoded.

#### Accessing the Env struct

Below is a simple coin flip function that uses the randomness feature:

```rust
pub fn try_flip(deps: DepsMut, env: Env) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    config(deps.storage).update(|mut state| -> Result<_, ContractError> {
        let coin_flip = env.block.random.unwrap().0[0] % 2;
        state.flip = coin_flip;
        Ok(state)
    })?;

    deps.api.debug("flipped!");
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

`try_flip()` uses the `config` function to update the state of the smart contract by flipping a coin and storing the result in the `flip` field in the `state` variable. Specifically, **it generates a random number using the `random` field of the `env.block` object**, **which is an optional value representing the most recent block's metadata, and takes the modulo 2 to obtain a value of either 0 or 1**. It then updates the `flip` field of the `state` variable to this value.

### Interacting with the Coin Flip Contract

Now, let's compile, upload, instantiate, and execute the contract to see it in action!&#x20;

#### Compile

To compile your contract, in your terminal run:

```rust
make build-mainnet
```

This returns the optimized contract wasm file, ie `contract.wasm.gz`

#### Upload

To upload your contract to a containerized version of LocalSecret in docker, make sure you have docker installed and open, and then create a new tab in your terminal and run:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
docker run -it --rm -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -p 1317:1317 -p 5000:5000 --name localsecret ghcr.io/scrtlabs/localsecret:v1.9.0-beta.1-random
```
{% endcode %}

Congrats, you now have a new instance of LocalSecret running that can access the random number feature!

Next, [create and fund a wallet ](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/getting-started/compile-and-deploy#creating-a-wallet)so you can upload the contract to LocalSecret. Then run the following to upload:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
secretcli tx compute store contract.wasm.gz --gas 5000000 --from <your wallet address> --chain-id secretdev-1
```
{% endcode %}

To confirm that the contract upload was successful:

```
secretcli query compute list-code
```

#### Instantiate

Now let's instantiate our contract with a starting flip of 1 (1 meaning Heads or Tales, up to you!)

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
secretcli tx compute instantiate 1 '{"flip": 1}' --from <your wallet address> --label flipContract
```
{% endcode %}

To confirm that the contract instantiation was successful:

```
secretcli query compute list-contract-by-code 1
```

#### Execute

Now that we have a **contract address** (which is returned from the `list-contract-by-code` query above), we an execute the coin flip with the randomness feature!&#x20;

To flip the coin simply run:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
secretcli tx compute execute <your contract address> '{"flip": {}}' --from myWallet
```
{% endcode %}

And to query that it was successful, run:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
secretcli query compute query <your contract address> '{"get_flip": {}}'
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You might have to execute the flip function a few times to see the queried flip change, since there is a 50% chance the flip will return the same number :D
{% endhint %}

### Summary

Congrats! In this step-by-step tutorial on creating a coin flip contract, you learned how to compile, upload, instantiate, and execute a contract on LocalSecret using Secret Network's randomness API to generate random numbers ðŸŽ‰
