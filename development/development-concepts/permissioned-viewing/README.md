# Permissioned Viewing

Permissioned viewing is entirely unique to Secret Network with its encrypted state. It gives you ability to have precise control over who has access to what data. In order to determine when data is allowed to be released however, you need to have a way to prove who is trying to access it. Our two ways of doing this are through Viewing Keys and Permits/Certs.

## How To Choose Between Viewing Keys and Permits

With the new Shockwave alpha update, Permits have become more efficient in almost every application. The exception is inter-contract communication permissions. Here, viewing keys still hold a lead. However, in some cases you may want to include an option to use both in your smart contract and leave the decision up to the users. Some users will have a preference for one over the other.
