### Secret University

Learn to build on Secret Network with [Secret University](https://scrt.university/pathways) and dive deep into the code with [Secret University Boxes](https://scrt.university/repositories), which are pre-built, preconfigured dApp templates built on Secret Network. Each Secret Box runs in its own sandbox developer environment and comes preconfigured with a simple UI kit.&#x20;
