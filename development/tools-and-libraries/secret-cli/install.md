# Install

To install the _secretcli_ [download the latest version here. ](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases)Download the appropriate version of the _secretcli_ based on the operating system you are using:

* secretcli-Linux
* secretcli-macOS
* secretcli-MacOS-arm64
* secretcli-Windows

### Linux

After downloading secretcli-Linux you will need to navigate to the folder you have download it to make secretcli-Linux an executable program using a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command-line.

**Note:** Installing secretcli-Linux will ONLY give you access to the `secretcli` commands. For `secretcli` and `secretd` commands install one of the .deb packages.

#### GUI

Right click on the secretcli-Linux file and select 'Properties', then select 'Permissions', and then check the 'Allow executing the file as program' box beside the 'Execute' column.

#### Command-line

To make secretcli-Linux executable using the command-line navigate to where the file is located and use the following command:

```
chmod +x secretcli-Linux
```

#### Next Steps

You can now use the `secretcli` by using the following command inside of the folder it is located in with:

```
./secretcli-Linux
```

You will see some outputs related to available commands, flags, and usage.

It is recommended to rename seretcli-Linux to 'secretcli', and move the executable file into the correct location so it is automatically executable by typing `secretcli` anywhere within the command-line.

To achieve this use the following commands in the directory containing secretcli-Linux:

```
sudo mv secretcli-Linux /usr/local/bin/secretcli
```

**Congrats! The `secretcli` is now installed!**

### Mac

Download the correct version of the `secretcli` for the Mac hardware on your system [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases). After downloading the `secretcli` there are two steps required to allow your system to execute the cli.

First, open your terminal application and navigate to the directory containing the `secretcli` file for your systems hardware. Once in the correct directory you will need to rename the file, and make the file executable using the following commands:

```bash
# for intel mac users use the command below 
mv secretcli-macOS secretcli

# for arm64 mac users use the command below 
mv secretcli-MacOS-arm64 secretcli

# Now make the file executable
chmod 755 secretcli
```

Mac users are required to perform another step after making the `secretcli` executable on their machines. This is because MacOs cannot recognize the developer of the secretcli file. Try running the following command in the directory containing the executable `secretcli`:

```bash
./secretcli
```

You will get a warning popup window with text similar to the following --> **“secretcli” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.** There will be two options: move to trash or cancel. Select cancel.

In order to get your MaOs system to be able to execute the `secretcli`, you will need to change the system preferences on your mac by going to the Apple menu <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/6226843B0C3B6F4420549000/6226843E0C3B6F442054900F/en_GB/2f77cc85238452e25cb517130188bf99.png" alt="" data-size="line">> System Preferences > click Security & Privacy <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/6226843B0C3B6F4420549000/6226843E0C3B6F442054900F/en_GB/106ba2d7107ef06182690a344e00b1ce.png" alt="" data-size="line"> > then click General.

You will see the text: "secretcli" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer. Click the 'Allow Anyway' button.

Now you should be able to use the `secretcli` when inside of the folder it is found in:

```
./secretcli 
```

You will see the following warning popup, click 'open'.

We recommend moving the `secretcli` into your path to be able to use it anywhere within your systems terminal application with:

```
mv secretcli /usr/local/bin
```

**Congrats! The `secretcli` is now installed!**

### Windows (WSL)

`secretcli-Linux` is compatible for use within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Follow the Linux Command-line instructions to install it.

### Windows (Native)

After downloading secretcli-Windows you can now use the `secretcli` by using the following command inside of the folder it is located in:

```
./secretcli-Windows
```

You will see some outputs related to available commands, flags, and usage.

It is recommended to rename seretcli-Windows to 'secretcli.exe', and move the executable file to a location where it is automatically executable by typing `secretcli` anywhere within the command-line.

To achieve this use the following commands in a Powershell terminal, in the directory containing secretcli-Windows:

```powershell
mkdir "$home\appdata\local\secretcli"
mv secretcli-Windows "$home/appdata/local/secretcli/secretcli.exe"
$old_path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('path', 'user');
$new_path = $old_path + ';' + "$home\appdata\local\secretcli"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', $new_path,'User');
```

Restart your terminal and test the installation by running:

```powershell
secretcli
```

#### Update SecretCLI (Windows)

To update or install a different version of SecretCLI on Windows, download the release of secretcli-Windows and move it to the correct location:

```powershell
mv secretcli-Windows "$home/appdata/local/secretcli/secretcli.exe"
```

The other commands do not need to be run again if they have already been run on your account.
