# Registration troubleshooting

#### After Initializing the enclave like so:

```bash
SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib secretd init-enclave
```

(or `SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib secretd init-enclave | grep -Po 'isvEnclaveQuoteStatus":".+?"'`)

An outtput like this should be generated:

```
INFO  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::registration::attestation] Attestation report: {"id":"183845695958032083367610248637243990718","timestamp":"2020-07-12T09:43:12.297820","version":4,"advisoryURL":"https://security-center.intel.com","advisoryIDs":["INTEL-SA-00334"],"isvEnclaveQuoteStatus":"SW_HARDENING_NEEDED","isvEnclaveQuoteBody":"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"}
```

(or `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus":"SW_HARDENING_NEEDED"`)

Where the important fields are **isvEnclaveQuoteStatus** and **advisoryIDs**. This is are fields that mark the trust level of our platform. The acceptable values for the `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus` field are:

* OK
* SW\_HARDENING\_NEEDED

With the following value accepted for **testnet only**:

* GROUP\_OUT\_OF\_DATE

For the status `CONFIGURATION_AND_SW_HARDENING_NEEDED` we perform a deeper inspection of the exact vulnerabilities that remain. The acceptable values **for mainnet** are:

* `"INTEL-SA-00334"`
* `"INTEL-SA-00219"`

Consult with the [Intel API](https://api.trustedservices.intel.com/documents/sgx-attestation-api-spec.pdf#page=21) for more on these values.

If you do not see such an output, look for a file called `attestation_cert.der` which should have been created in your `$HOME` directory. You can then use the command `secretd parse <path/to/attestation_cert.der>` to check the result a successful result should be a 64 byte hex string (e.g. `0x9efe0dc689447514d6514c05d1161cea15c461c62e6d72a2efabcc6b85ed953b`.

#### What to do if this didn't work?

1. Running `secretd init-enclave` should have created a file called `attestation_cert.der`. This file contains the attestation report from above.
2. Contact us on the proper channels on `chat.scrt.network`
3. The details we will need to investigate will include:
   * Hardware specs
   * SGX PSW/driver versions
   * BIOS versions
   * The file `attestation_cert.der`

#### Troubleshooting

**Output is:**

```
secretd init-enclave
2020-07-12 13:21:31,864 ERROR [go_cosmwasm] Error :(
ERROR: failed to initialize enclave: Error calling the VM: SGX_ERROR_ENCLAVE_FILE_ACCESS
```

Make sure you have the environment variable `SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib` set before you run `secretd`.

**Output is:**

```
secretd init-enclave
ERROR  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::crypto::key_manager] Error sealing registration key

2020-07-12 13:37:26,690 ERROR [go_cosmwasm] Error :(
ERROR: failed to initialize enclave: Error calling the VM: SGX_ERROR_UNEXPECTED
```

Make sure the directory `~/.sgx_secrets/` is created. If that still doesn't work, try to create `/root/.sgx_secrets`

**Output is:**

```
secretd init-enclave
ERROR  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::registration::attestation] Error in create_attestation_report: SGX_ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
ERROR  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::registration::offchain] Error in create_attestation_certificate: SGX_ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
ERROR: failed to create attestation report: Error calling the VM: SGX_ERROR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
```

Make sure the `aesmd-service` is running `systemctl status aesmd.service`

**Output is:**

```
secretd init-enclave

ERROR  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::registration::cert] Platform is updated but requires further BIOS configuration
ERROR  [wasmi_runtime_enclave::registration::cert] The following vulnerabilities must be mitigated: ["INTEL-SA-00161", "You must disable hyperthreading in the BIOS", "INTEL-SA-00289", "You must disable overclocking/undervolting in the BIOS"]
Platform status is SW_HARDENING_AND_CONFIGURATION_NEEDED. This means is updated but requires further BIOS configuration
```

Please disable hyperthreading and overclocking/undervolting (Turboboost) in your BIOS.

**I'm seeing `CONFIGURATION_AND_SW_HARDENING_NEEDED` in the `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus` field, but with more advisories than what is allowed**

This could mean a number of different things related to the configuration of the machine. Most common are:

* \["INTEL-SA-00161", "INTEL-SA-00233"] - Hyper-threading must be disabled in the BIOS
* \["INTEL-SA-00289"] - Overclocking/undervolting must be disabled by the BIOS (sometimes known as Turboboost)
* \["INTEL-SA-00219"] - Integrated graphics should be disabled in the BIOS - we recommend performing this step if you can, though it isn't required

If you are still having trouble getting rid of INTEL-SA-00219 and INTEL-SA-00289, here are some possible settings to look for outside of the CPU settings:

* Primary Display = 'PCI Express'
* IGPU Multi-Monitor = Disabled
* Onboard VGA = Disabled

**I'm seeing `SGX_ERROR_DEVICE_BUSY`**

Most likely you tried reinstalling the driver and rerunning the enclave - restarting should solve the problem
