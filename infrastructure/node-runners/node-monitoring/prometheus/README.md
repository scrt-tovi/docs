# Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/) is a flexible monitoring solution in development since 2012. The software stores all its data in a time series database and offers a multi-dimensional data model and a powerful query language to generate reports of the monitored resources.

This tutorial makes no assumptions about previous knowledge, other than:

1. You are comfortable with a Linux operating system, specifically Ubuntu 20.04
2. You are comfortable being able to ssh into your node, as all operations will be done from the command line\\
