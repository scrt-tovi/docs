# Hardware Compliance

This is not a comprehensive list of compliant hardware, but rather a guide for what has been verified to work. [This list](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware) is often show as SGX compliant, but it does not discriminate against whether SGX is supported via SPS or IntelME. Only SGX via SPS is supported.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CPU must support SGX via SPS.** CPUs that only support SGX via IntelME will not work.
{% endhint %}

## Supported CPUs <a href="#cpus" id="cpus"></a>

The following are confirmed compliant Intel CPUs:

| Brand | Family            | Model             |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Intel | XEON E-Series     | `E-2176G`         |
|       |                   | `E-2178G`         |
|       |                   | `E-2186G`         |
|       |                   | `E-2188G`         |
|       |                   | `E-2276G`         |
|       |                   | `E-2278G`         |

|       |                   | `E-2388G`         |
|       | XEON Gold-Series  | \*NOT SUPPORTED\* |
| AMD   | \*NOT SUPPORTED\* |                   |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only Intel processors support SGX. AMD processors are \*NOT\* supported.
