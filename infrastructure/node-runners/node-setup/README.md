# Mainnet Setup

This section will take you through the process of taking a node from fresh machine to full validator. The general steps are as follows:

1. [Install SGX](install-sgx.md)
2. [Install secretd](install-secretd.md)
3. [Setup the Full Node](setup-full-node.md)
4. [Convert Full Node into Validator](becoming-a-validator.md)

If you wish to create an archive node, replace step 3 with [Running an Archive Node](../sentry-archive-and-ibc-node-setup/archive-nodes.md).
