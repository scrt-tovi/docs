# Setup Full Node

This document details how to join the Secret Network `secret-4` mainnet as a full node. Once your full node is running and state synced to the current block, you can turn it into a validator in the optional last step.

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Secret Network has strict Hardware Requirements. If your machine does not meet them, it will \*NOT\* work as a node.
{% endhint %}

* Ubuntu/Debian host (with ZFS or LVM to be able to add more storage easily)
* A public IP address
* Open ports `TCP 26656 & 26657` _Note: If you're behind a router or firewall then you'll need to port forward on the network device._
* Reading [Tendermint: Running in production](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html)
* RPC address of an already active node. You can use any node that exposes RPC services.
* Refer to [Intel Processor Specifications](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@Processors) if you're unsure if your processor supports SGX

### **Minimum Requirements**

* 32GB RAM
* 512GB SDD
* 1 dedicated core of any Intel Skylake processor (IntelÂ® 6th generation) or better (Xeon gen3 (Ice Lake) NOT supported)
* Motherboard with support for SGX in the BIOS

### **Recommended Requirements**

* 32GB RAM
* 1TB NVMe SSD
* 2 dedicated cores of any Intel Skylake processor (IntelÂ® 6th generation) or better (Xeon gen3 (Ice Lake) NOT supported)
* Motherboard with support for SGX in the BIOS

## Installation <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

### **Install SGX and `secretd`**

{% hint style="danger" %}
This guide assumes you've already installed the latest version of secretd and SGX. To setup an archive node, you must follow the [Archive Nodes](../sentry-archive-and-ibc-node-setup/archive-nodes.md) instructions.
{% endhint %}

For more information on SGX, see instructions for [SGX Installation](install-sgx.md) and [Verifying SGX](broken-reference/). See [Node Registration Information](broken-reference/) if you'd like a more comprehensive overview on what's happening in these steps.

### **Initialize Secret Network Configs**

Choose a **moniker** for yourself, and replace `<MONIKER>` with your moniker below. This moniker will serve as your public nickname in the network.

```bash
secretd init <MONIKER> --chain-id secret-4
```

This will generate the following files in `~/.secretd/config/`

* `genesis.json`
* `node_key.json`
* `priv_validator_key.json`

### **Download `genesis.json`**

The genesis file is how other nodes on the network know what network you should be on.

```bash
wget -O ~/.secretd/config/genesis.json "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.2.0/genesis.json"
# verify genesis.json checksum
echo "759e1b6761c14fb448bf4b515ca297ab382855b20bae2af88a7bdd82eb1f44b9 $HOME/.secretd/config/genesis.json" | sha256sum --check
```

### **Initialize Secret Enclave**

Initialize `/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets`:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets
```

You can choose between two methods, [**automatic**](setup-full-node.md#initialize-secret-enclave---automatic-registration-experimental) **or** [**manual**](setup-full-node.md#initialize-secret-enclave---manual-registration):

#### **Initialize Secret Enclave - Automatic Registration (EXPERIMENTAL)**

{% hint style="danger" %}
WARNING: This method is experimental, and may not work. If it doesn't work, skip to [manual registration](setup-full-node.md#initialize-secret-enclave---manual-registration).
{% endhint %}

The following commands will create the necessary environment variables and attempt to automatically register the node.

```bash
export SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib
export SCRT_SGX_STORAGE=/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets
secretd auto-register
```

If this step was successful, you can skip straight to [Optimization](setup-full-node.md#optimization).

#### **Initialize Secret Enclave - Manual Registration**

```bash
secretd init-enclave
```

### Verify Enclave Initialization

The attestation certificate should have been created by the previous step

```bash
ls -lh /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der
```

Verify the certificate is valid. A 64-character registration key will be printed if it was successful.

```bash
PUBLIC_KEY=$(secretd parse /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der 2> /dev/null | cut -c 3-)
echo $PUBLIC_KEY
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
If registration was NOT succesfull consider checking out the [Registration troubleshooting](../../setting-up-a-node-validator/hardware-setup/registration-troubleshooting.md) help or contact a fellow validator on our [discord](https://chat.scrt.network).
{% endhint %}

### **Configure `secretd`**

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps should use `secretd` be ran on the full node itself. To run the steps with `secretd` on a local machine, [set up the CLI](https://docs.scrt.network/cli/install-cli.html) there.
{% endhint %}

Configure `secretd`. Initially you'll be using the bootstrap node, as you'll need to connect to a running node and your own node is not running yet.

```bash
secretd config chain-id secret-4
secretd config node https://lcd-secret.scrtlabs.com:443/rpc
secretd config output json
```

### **Fund Secret Wallet**

If you already have a wallet funded with `SCRT`, you can import the wallet by doing the following:

```bash
secretd keys add <key-alias> --recover
```

Otherwise, you will need to set up a key. Make sure you back up the mnemonic and the keyring password.

```bash
secretd keys add <key-alias>
```

This will output your address, a 45 character-string starting with `secret1...`.

### **Configure Node Attestation**

1. Register your node on-chain

```bash
secretd tx register auth /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der -y --from <key-alias>
```

2\. Pull & check your node's encrypted seed from the network

```bash
SEED=$(secretd query register seed $PUBLIC_KEY | cut -c 3-)
echo $SEED
```

3\. Get additional network parameters

These are necessary to configure the node before it starts.

```bash
secretd query register secret-network-params
ls -lh ./io-master-key.txt ./node-master-key.txt
```

### **Configure Secret Node**

{% hint style="info" %}
From here on, commands must be ran on the full node.
{% endhint %}

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.secretd/.node
secretd configure-secret node-master-key.txt $SEED
```

### **Optimization**

In order to be able to handle NFT minting and other Secret Contract-heavy operations, it's recommended to update your SGX memory enclave cache:

```bash
sed -i.bak -e "s/^contract-memory-enclave-cache-size *=.*/contract-memory-enclave-cache-size = \"15\"/" ~/.secretd/config/app.toml
```

Also checkout [this document](https://gist.github.com/blockpane/40bc6b64caa48fdaff3b0760acb51eaa) by `block pane` for fine tuning your machine for better uptime.

### **Set `minimum-gas-price` Parameter**

We recommend `0.0125uscrt` per gas unit:

```bash
perl -i -pe 's/^minimum-gas-prices = .+?$/minimum-gas-prices = "0.0125uscrt"/' ~/.secretd/config/app.toml
```

Your node will not accept transactions that specify `--fees` lower than the `minimun-gas-price` you set here.

### **Enable `secret-node`:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the `secret-node` system file is created when installing sgx.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo systemctl enable secret-node && sudo systemctl start secret-node
```

If everything above worked correctly, the following command will show your node streaming blocks (this is for debugging purposes only, kill this command anytime with Ctrl-C).

```bash
journalctl -f -u secret-node
```

```bash

You are now a full node. ðŸŽ‰

### Get Node ID <a href="#_21-get-your-node-id-with" id="_21-get-your-node-id-with"></a>

`secretd tendermint show-node-id`

And publish yourself as a node with this ID:

```
<your-node-id>@<your-public-ip>:26656
```

Be sure to point your CLI to your running node instead of the bootstrap node

`secretcli config node tcp://localhost:26657`

If someone wants to add you as a peer, have them add the above address to their persistent\_peers in their \~/.secretd/config/config.toml.

And if someone wants to use your node from their secretcli then have them run:

```
secretcli config chain-id secret-4
secretcli config output json
secretcli config indent true
secretcli config node tcp://<your-public-ip>:26657
```

### **Snapshot**

To sync to head quickly, please see [snapshot.md](../../setting-up-a-node-validator/node-setup/snapshot.md "mention").

### **State Sync**

You can skip syncing from scratch or download a snapshot by [State Syncing](https://docs.scrt.network/docs/node-runners/node-setup/state-sync) to the current block.

### **Optional: Become a Validator**

To turn your full node into a validator, see [Joining Mainnet as a Validator](https://docs.scrt.network/docs/node-runners/node-setup/becoming-a-validator).
