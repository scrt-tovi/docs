# Mantlemint

### What is Mantlemint?

Mantlemint is a fast core optimized for serving massive user queries. A mantlemint node will perform 3-4x more queries than a standard Secret Node.

Native query performance on RPC is slow and is not suitable for massive query handling, due to the inefficiencies introduced by IAVL tree. Mantlemint is running on `fauxMerkleTree` mode, basically removing the IAVL inefficiencies while using the same core to compute the same module outputs.

If you are looking to serve any kind of public node accepting varying degrees of end-user queries, it is recommended that you run a mantlemint instance alongside of your RPC. While mantlemint is indeed faster at resolving queries, due to the absence of IAVL tree and native tendermint, it cannot join p2p network by itself. Rather, you would have to relay finalized blocks to mantlemint, using RPC's websocket.

Mantlemint has been adapted for Secret Network from Terra.

### Features

* Superior LCD performance
  * With the exception of Tendermint RPC/Transactions.
* Super reliable and effective LCD response cache to prevent unnecessary computation for query resolving
* Fully archival; historical states are available with `?height` query parameter.
* [Useful default indexes](https://github.com/scrtlabs/mantlemint#default-indexes)

### Prerequisites

1. Fully synced RPC Node with Websockets available

To start a Mantlemint node, you'll need \*\*\*\* access to at least 1 running RPC node. Since Mantlemint cannot join p2p network by itself, it depends on RPC to receive recently proposed blocks. This RPC node should also have Websockets enabled. Websockets are how Mantlemint receives new blocks after it catches up to the current block.

### Minimum Requirements

1. 1TB of storage (recommended SATA or NVMe SSD)
2. 16 GB of RAM (recommended 32 GB)
3. 2 available CPU cores (recommended 4 cores)

Mantlemint can only be ran as a full archive node. For this reason it requires a large amount of storage (as of August 2022 this is currently 450GB).

### Setup

#### 1a. Build from source

a. Clone the repository [https://github.com/scrtlabs/mantlemint](https://github.com/scrtlabs/mantlemint)

```
git clone https://github.com/scrtlabs/mantlemint.git
```

b. If you haven't already, [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

c. Run `go build -mod=readonly -o build/mantlemint ./sync.go`

#### 1b. Run from Binary

If you don't want to compile yourself, you can just download the `mantlemint` executable built for Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
wget -O mantlemint https://github.com/scrtlabs/mantlemint/releases/download/v0.0.1-scrt/mantlemint
```

#### 2. Install SGX

Install SGX the same way you would for a node, as described in the [Node Setup section](../node-setup/install-sgx.md)

#### 3. Download and unpack the `secretd` package

```bash
wget "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.3.1/secretnetwork_1.3.1_mainnet_goleveldb_amd64.deb"
sudo apt install -y ./secretnetwork_1.3.1_mainnet_*_amd64.deb
```

#### 4. Register the node

To allow Mantlemint to sync blocks and run queries that contain encrypted data, we will need to [register](broken-reference) it.

```bash
export SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib
export SCRT_SGX_STORAGE=/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets
secretd auto-register
```

#### 5. Create a directory for mantlemint data

This directory should be separate from other mantlemint instances or secretd instances

```bash
mkdir -p $home/.mantlemint
```

#### 6. Create an app.toml file

Create a `config/app.toml` file in your mantlemint directory, and set it with a similar app.toml file to what a `secretd` node uses

```bash
mkdir -p $home/.mantlemint/config
```

Example `app.toml` file:

```toml
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

#### 7. Download Genesis File

```
wget -O $home/.mantlemint/config/genesis.json "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.2.0/genesis.json"
```

#### 8. Download a snapshot

To start mantlemint, we highly recommend using a snapshot. The earlier one starting from block 3340000. This will save having to switch out mantlemint binaries to account for network upgrades.

To download and unpack a snapshot, use the following command

```bash
wget -qO - https://engfilestorage.blob.core.windows.net/mm-snapshots/height_3340000.tar | tar -xvf - -C /path/to/mm/directory
```

Make sure the files are unpacked in your chosen mantlemint directory

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Pro Tip:** Currently Mantlemint is fully archival. That means snapshots are really large. This command will download and unpack the snapshot without having to use twice the storage amount
{% endhint %}

#### 9. Finally, you run Mantlemint

Now we are ready to run Mantlemint. It's slightly awkward to run as you have to set multiple environment variables, but they're fairly straightforward. An example run command would be -

<pre><code><strong># Tell SGX we are running on a production chain
</strong><strong>SGX_MODE=HW \
</strong>
# Location of genesis file
<strong>GENESIS_PATH=$home/.mantlemint/config/genesis.json \
</strong>
# Home directory for mantlemint.
# Mantlemint will use this to:
# - read $HOME/config/app.toml
# - create and maintain $HOME/mantlemint.db directory
# - create and maintain $HOME/data/* for wasm blobs; (unsafe to share with RPC!)
# - create and maintain $HOME/$(INDEXER_DB).db for mantle indexers
MANTLEMINT_HOME=./hd/mm \ 

# Chain ID 
CHAIN_ID=secret-4  \

# RPC Endpoint; used to sync previous blocks when mantlemint is catching up
RPC_ENDPOINTS=http://20.104.20.173:26657,http://20.104.20.173:26657 \

# Name of mantlemint.db, akin to application.db in standard cosmos/tendermint
MANTLEMINT_DB=mantlemint \ 
# Name of indexer db
INDEXER_DB=indexer \ 

# WS Endpoint; used to sync live block as soon as they are available through RPC websocket  
WS_ENDPOINTS=ws://20.104.20.173:26657/websocket,ws://20.104.20.173:26657/websocket \

# Flag to enable/disable mantlemint sync, mainly for debugging
DISABLE_SYNC=false \ 

# Flags that help mantlemint find the secret-specific libraries and secret keys
SCRT_SGX_STORAGE="/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets" 
SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR="/usr/lib" \

./mantlemint --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
</code></pre>

That's it!
