# Local CLI

## Using Local CLI Machines

Never save your validator’s keys on the remote server. You should be using your local machine and saving your keys on there to broadcast to the remote server.

In order to use a local CLI, you must:

1. Install the daemon on your local machine by going through the normal installation process
2. Set the daemon’s `config` to the remote server
