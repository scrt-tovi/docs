# Development

The Development Committeeâ€™s purpose is to foster a safe space for developers and teams to collaborate on the latest developments within Secret Network. The Committee will hold itself to the following core responsibilities:

1. Committee Meetings hosted every Monday at 5:00 PM UTC
2. Create [Community Code Repositories](../../funding/developer-bounties/ccr-and-ccbl.md) with tightly scoped acceptance criteria (AC). Offer micro-bounties to any person or company who submits a PR that satisfies all AC. These projects are designed to be completed in 1 to 5 working days depending on the experience level of the contributor.
3. Appropriate funds to a Mentorship Program, whereas a recognized development member will be paid from the discretionary budget for pair programming time with new committee members who are looking for a faster onramp into the Network. The Development committee leads are Gino and Lumi who are available for contact via the #development channels in Discord or their emails gino@scrtnetwork.co and lumi@scrtnetwork.co
