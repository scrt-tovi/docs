# Support

The goal of the official Secret Network support team is to be a first line of defense for users on the Secret Network. The team has been present and active during nearly every NFT mint/major event both in the Secret Community Discord and Telegram, as well as the projectâ€™s respective channels.

The support committee consists of 2 members (Waffle, and MrGarbanzo) who you can recognize by their @support role in discord and Admin status in the official Telegram.
