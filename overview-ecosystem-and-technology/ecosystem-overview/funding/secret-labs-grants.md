# Accelerator/Ecosystem Pool

Funded in SCRT and primarily managed by SCRT Labs, the Accelerator Pool is used to support critical growth initiatives across Secret DeFi, NFTs, gaming and metaverse, and other essential application verticals on Secret Network. Initiatives will target the core network metrics especially active usage, userbase, and TVL.

In addition, the Accelerator Pool will be a source of non-dilutive early stage funding in the form of grants to teams building applications, ecosystem tooling, and network-level improvements that support our ambitious growth goals. This funding is intended to be used as an initial foundation for developers before they turn to the Secret Ecosystem Fund and work towards global growth.

Grants have already been approved for over a dozen initiatives, including the development of the [Secret NFT reference implementation](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/Grants/issues/2), the [Secret Monero Bridge](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/Grants/issues/3), Shade protocol, Polymer.fi developer frameworks like [Polar](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/Grants/issues/15) and [Griptape](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/Grants/issues/19), Secret IDE, this documentation and many more.

## How to apply for a Grant

{% hint style="info" %}
_If you need help with applying for a grant or want to connect with Business development then please reach out to: SCRT Labs (_[_info@scrtlabs.com_](mailto:info@scrtlabs.com)_) or_ [_the Secret Agency_](../contributors-and-entities/secret-agency.md)_._
{% endhint %}

### Funding Amounts

Funding amounts are variable and can go as high as several hundred thousand dollars, depending on the complexity and value to the network, although the average grant would likely be in the order of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Grants may be split into several smaller milestones and receive funding accordingly on a per-milestone basis, as mentioned below. Since this is a non-dilutive funding opportunity, we encourage commercial projects to look for alternative sources of funding as well. We are especially interested in seeing new start-up companies and projects emerge that build exclusively on Secret Network. **For these, non-dilutive funding such as a grant would be significant.**

Grant awards will be distributed in 3 or more installments, with initial payment to take place right after approval of the grant. Teams must define critical milestones for the project and propose installment amounts upon completion of different milestones.

### Requirements

All code must be open source. If there’s a good reason to make an exception, please specify this in your proposal, and emphasize which parts (if any) will be open source. Please mention the license you plan to use in your application.

#### Who Are We Looking For

We are looking for individual developers, new and existing companies and projects, community members, or established teams with a proven track record to contribute to the Secret Network ecosystem. Prior work on Secret Network or experience in deploying Ethereum or other blockchain applications is a big plus.

Secret Apps are encouraged to have a path for commercial sustainability (token or fee model).
