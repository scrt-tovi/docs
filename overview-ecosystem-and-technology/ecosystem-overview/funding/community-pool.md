# Community Pool

The Secret Network has a on-chain community pool governed by SCRT stakers. The community pool is a way for various teams to get funding denominated in SCRT. Most committees who work on the Secret Network get their quarterly funding from the community pool.\
\
The community pool is funded from an on-chain staking tax, 2% of the token inflation on the network is send to the community pool address. To get funding from the community pool one needs to submit an official governance proposal on-chain by using the SecretCLI. Documentation for proposing a funding request can be found [here](../../../development/tools-and-libraries/secret-cli/governance/creating-governance-proposals.md).\
\
When creating a Governance proposal we suggest you to follow the [Secret Network Charter & Code of conduct](https://forum.scrt.network/t/2022-q1-secret-network-charter-code-of-conduct/5281/) as voted on in proposal #81. This Charter lays out the process of creating a proposal and asking for community feedback. The charter also provides a clear guidance for determining the amount of SCRT required for funding certain proposals.\
\
Everyone is free to create a Governance proposal to ask for community funds, please reach out to the community via the[ Forum](https://forum.scrt.network/) first.
