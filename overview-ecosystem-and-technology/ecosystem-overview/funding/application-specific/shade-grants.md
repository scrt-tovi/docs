# Shade Grants

In February 2022, Shade Protocol announced Shade Grants alongside raising $5 million in private funding. The core Shade Protocol team oversees Shade Grants. All grants are designated in [$SHD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shade-protocol/) to support:&#x20;

1. Growth initiatives for Silk adoption&#x20;
2. Shade Protocol integrations&#x20;
3. Community initiatives&#x20;
4. User Tooling&#x20;

All Shade Grants aim to improve core metrics of the Shade Protocol: revenue, TVL, accessibility, and availability. Applications are open to Secret Network developers and community members through the [Shade Grants Github page](https://github.com/securesecrets/ShadeGrants/tree/main).&#x20;
