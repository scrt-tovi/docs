# CCBL

### Community Curated Bounty List

The Community Curated Bounty List was initiated by the Governance committee and is a signalling proposal in which multiple development projects with funding up to 25,000 SCRT get a green light from the community. These on-chain approved ideas will make it easier for developers to ask subsequent funding from the community pool, via a governance proposal, to complete these development tasks.\
\
The CCBL was first introduced in [proposal #71 ](https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/71)and later updated in [proposal #101](https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/101) adding more ideas and a higher max budget. People who approach the CCBL will have the opportunity to get connected to individuals who are happy to help push the idea forward, refine it, and turn it into something that the on-chain community pool would be willing to fund assuming the right entity stepped up to build/execute on it. \
\
Before every Validator Survey new submissions will be vetted in a public CCBL Working Group meeting to make sure the ideas conform to the current boundary conditions as agreed to by the validators. The Validator Survey which will determine eventual inclusion in the on-chain proposal is currently sent out every 3 months.

#### Requirements

* Projects that can have their results (or a proof-of-concept) available within a month of full-time development. In the case of an individual developer there is some leniency.
* No projects that are already in active development.
* Projects need to be specific, so not just 'a casino'.\
