One of the issues with blockchain gaming is having your NFT and assets public, giving your opponents an edge against you. Leveraging private NFT metadata, Secret will disrupt the entire industry and give all players the same chance to be the best.

Secret gaming is also taking advantage of its private on-chain randomness number generation with Secret RNG which provides fair and private outcomes for gaming.
