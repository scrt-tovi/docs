# The Initialization Of Secret Network

## Bootstrap Process

Secret Network is set up to perform computation while having encrypted state, input and output. The state is encrypted using private keys generated during the network bootstrapping from a `consensus_seed`. The bootstrap node was the first full node on the network and generated the shared secrets similar to a universal trusted zero knowledge setup.

The bootstrap node first does a remote attestation to prove they are running a genuine SGX enclave with updated software. After registering the bootstrap node handled the initialization of following variables:

* `Consensus_seed` a true random 256 bit seed used as entropy for generating shareable keypairs between the nodes of the network.
* `consensus_seed_exchange_pubkey` - `consensus_seed_exchange_pubkey` an HDKF private key and a matching curve25519 public key for encryption of the random seed and sharing this with other full nodes in the network.
* `consensus_io_exchange_pubkey` - `consensus_io_exchange_pubkey` an HDKF private key and a matching curve25519 public key for encrypting transactions IO in the network. Also referenced as the "Secret Network keypair".
* `consensus_state_ikm` An input keyring material (IKM) for HKDF-SHA256 is used to derive encryption keys for contract state.
* `consensus_callback_secret` A curve25519 private key is used to create callback signatures when contracts call other contracts

### Bootstrap process epilogue

#### 1. Remote attestation

The bootstrap node proves to have a genuine enclave after which it can participate in the network. More information can be found on [this page](../intel-sgx/remote-attestation.md).

#### 2. generate `consensus_seed`

The bootstrap node is instructed when started to generate a true random 256 bit seed inside the enclave, the `consensus_seed`.

The `consensus_seed` is sealed with MRSIGNER to a local file : `$HOME/.sgx_secrets/consensus_seed.sealed`

```js
// 256 bits
consensus_seed = true_random({ bytes: 32 });

seal({
  key: "MRSIGNER",
  data: consensus_seed,
  to_file: "$HOME/.sgx_secrets/consensus_seed.sealed",
});
```

#### 2. Generate seed exchange keypair

For the network to start decentralizing the bootstrap node needs to be able to share the `consensus_seed`. The network can then use the seed to create shared secrets while in the enclave. To securely share the seed the Network uses a DH-key exchange.

Using HKDF-SHA256, `hkdf_salt` and `consensus_seed` a private key is derived. From `consensus_seed_exchange_privkey` calculate `consensus_seed_exchange_pubkey`

```js
consensus_seed_exchange_privkey = hkdf({
  salt: hkdf_salt,
  ikm: consensus_seed.append(uint8(1)),
}); // 256 bits

consensus_seed_exchange_pubkey = calculate_curve25519_pubkey(
  consensus_seed_exchange_privkey
);
```

#### 3. Generate IO encryption keypair

Using HKDF-SHA256, `hkdf_salt` and `consensus_seed` a private key is derived. - From `consensus_io_exchange_privkey` calculate `consensus_io_exchange_pubkey`

```
consensus_io_exchange_privkey = hkdf({
  salt: hkdf_salt,
  ikm: consensus_seed.append(uint8(2)),
}); // 256 bits

consensus_io_exchange_pubkey = calculate_curve25519_pubkey(
  consensus_io_exchange_privkey
);
```

#### 4. Generate `consensus_state_ikm`

Using HKDF-SHA256, `hkdf_salt` and `consensus_seed` derive `consensus_state_ikm`

```js
consensus_state_ikm = hkdf({
  salt: hkdf_salt,
  ikm: consensus_seed.append(uint8(3)),
}); // 256 bits
```

**5. `consensus_callback_secret`**

Using HKDF-SHA256, `hkdf_salt` and `consensus_seed` derive `consensus_callback_secret`

```
consensus_state_ikm = hkdf({
  salt: hkdf_salt,
  ikm: consensus_seed.append(uint8(4)),
}); // 256 bits
```

#### 6. add info to Genesis state
